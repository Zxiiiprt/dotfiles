# dotfiles

This Repo consists of some of my dotfiles & configurations for a Terminal Based Environment.
As always, setting up your own environment is a "work-in-progress" for eternity it seems.

At the moment this environment consists of:
+ Neovim configured with LSP for C/C++
+ Tmux
+ Fish (although it's a non-POSIX compliant shell)

## iTerm2 (MacOS Terminal)
## Fisher (Plugin Manager for Fish)
## WIP
